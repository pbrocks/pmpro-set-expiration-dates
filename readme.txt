Requires at least: 3.5
Tested up to: 4.5.3

Set a specific expiration date (e.g. 2013-12-31) for a PMPro membership level or discount code in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Enter "Y" for current year, "Y2" for next year. "M", "M2" for current/next month.
If the expiration date has already passed and "Y" is used, "Y" will start at the next year.

This expiration date will override any expiration period set on the level.
